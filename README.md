# Alternating Activations
The following rules are intended to replace the existing AoD turn-based "IGOUGO" in favor of an alternating activation system.

## The Turn
At the start of the game, determine the starting player as normal to determine the Player Order. Any mention of a Player Turn or Phase in a Player Turn in a base rule should be considered as any relevant part of the Game Turn where applicable unless otherwise noted.

In a given Activation step, Players activate units in order of Agility in a similar manner to Initiative in the Close Combat Phase starting with the first in the Player Order at each relevant Agility value.

*Example: Player A wins the roll-off at the start of the game and chooses first in the player order. During the Movement Phase, Player A and B both have multiple available units with the lowest Agility value. Player A (having priority in the Player Order) chooses one unit tied for the lowest value and resolves its movement. Player B then does the same. Player A may now move his second unit at that Agility value. This is continued until no units are left at that Agility value. Note that Player A's Agility step priority applies the same to other phases*

### Deployment
Depending on the mission, players may choose to alternate deployment as well. Players alternate placing units by the following categories (Deploying all by one category before moving to the next):
- Fortifications
- Heavy Support
- Troops
- Elites
- HQ*
- Fast Attack

\**Independent Characters may deploy attached to a unit at the same step*

### Movement Phase
Units are activated in ascending order of Agility.

### Psychic Phase
Units are activated in descending order of Mastery Level.

### Shooting Phase
Units are activated in descending order of Agility.

### Close Combat Phase
#### Charge Sub-phase
Charges are declared in descending order of Agility. Resolve all charges before the Fight phase begins.

#### Fight Sub-phase
Resolved as per the AoD ruleset.

### Agility
Agility is an attribute derived from initiative with certain modifiers. The Agility of a unit is derived from the highest initiative attribute of a model in the unit along with any relevant modifiers (such as status effects like Blind). To characterize the prowess of units beyond solely the Initiative attribute, additional modifiers to Agility are applied as described below (Non-walker vehicles and other "I -" are considered as base Initiative 1 for this purpose, unless otherwise noted):

#### Unit Type: (+1)
- Bikes & Jetbikes
- Jump & Jet Pack Units
- Cavalry
- Fast Vehicles
- Skimmers

#### Special Rules: (+1)
- Acute Senses
- Crusader (Movement only)
- Fleet (Movement Only)

#### Unit Type: (-1)
- Artillery(?)
- Heavy Vehicles
- Tanks

#### Special Rules: (-1)
- Slow & Purposeful (Cataphractii?)

### Zooming Flyers & Super-Heavies:
Due to their exceptional momentum, these units will always act as having 1 below the lowest Agility value in a given phase. (In essence, move first, shoot last)

# Optional Rule: Barrage Zeroing
Units may not make attacks with Barrage weapons during their activation step. At the beginning of the Shooting Phase, any unit with a Barrage weapon may instead place a zeroing marker at any valid location (usually the targeted model's position).

At the end of the shooting phase, resolve the attack even if the firing unit is no longer on the table. If the targeted unit has not moved since the zeroing marker was placed, its controller may re-roll the scatter dice.

## Sub-Rule: "Incoming!" (Go to Ground modification)
After being targeted by a Blast weapon (Before rolling for scatter), Infantry units that are eligible to Go to Ground may move d3" before doing so. This movement is resolved before rolling scatter, and the unit counts as having Gone to Ground this phase.
