# Optional Heresy Rules

## Alternating Activations
The following rules are intended to replace the existing AoD turn-based "IGOUGO" in favor of an alternating activation system.
### The Turn

At the start of the game, determine the starting player as normal to determine the Player Order. In a given Initiative step, player order will determine the first activation in the event of tied Initiative between two or more opposing units. During a given activation step, a player may choose any unit of that Initiative that has not been activated this Phase. The initiative of a unit is derived from the highest initiative attribute of a model in the unit.  The exact order of activation is as described below:

#### Movement Phase
Units are activated in ascending order of Initiative.

#### Psychic Phase
Units are activated in descending order of Mastery Level.

#### Shooting Phase
Units are activated in descending order of initiative.

#### Close Combat Phase
As per default AoD rules.

#### Initiative Modifiers
To emphasize the alertness and agility of units beyond their Initiative attribute, units receive bonuses and penalties to Initiative during the **Movement and Shooting Phases only**. Non-walker vehicles will be counted as having a base Initiative of 1.
