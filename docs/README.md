# Optional Heresy Rules

## Alternating Activations
The following rules are intended to replace the existing AoD turn-based "IGOUGO" in favor of an alternating activation system.
### The Turn

At the start of the game, determine the starting player as normal to determine the Player Order. In a given Initiative step, player order will determine the first activation in the event of tied Initiative between two or more opposing units. During a given activation step, a player may choose any unit of that Initiative that has not been activated this Phase. The initiative of a unit is derived from the highest initiative attribute of a model in the unit.  The exact order of activation is as described below:

#### Movement Phase
Units are activated in ascending order of Initiative.

#### Psychic Phase
Units are activated in descending order of Mastery Level.

#### Shooting Phase
Units are activated in descending order of initiative.

#### Close Combat Phase
As per default AoD rules.

#### Initiative Modifiers
To emphasize the alertness and agility of units beyond their Initiative attribute, units receive bonuses and penalties to Initiative during the **Movement and Shooting Phases only**. Non-walker vehicles will be counted as having a base Initiative of 1.

###### Unit Type: (+1)
- Bikes & Jetbikes
- Jump & Jet Pack Units
- Cavalry
- Fast Vehicles
- Skimmers

###### Special Rules: (+1)
- Acute Senses
- Crusader (Movement only)
- Fleet (Movement Only)

###### Unit Type: (-1)
- Artillery(?)
- Heavy Vehicles
- Tanks

###### Special Rules: (-1)
- Slow & Purposeful (Cataphractii?)

##### Zooming Flyers & Super-Heavies:
Due to their immense momentum (from either mass or velocity) these units will always act after the lowest possible Initiative step in a given phase.

### Optional Rule: Scatter!
Units that elect to Run in the Shooting Phase may end their movement outside of normal unit coherency (Usual restrictions and/or penalties apply afterward)

### Optional Rule: Barrage Zeroing
Units may not make attacks with Barrage weapons during their Initiative step. At the beginning of the Shooting Phase, place a zeroing marker on any valid target.

At the end of the shooting phase, resolve the attack even if the unit is no longer on the table. If the targeted unit has not moved since the zeroing marker was placed, its controller may re-roll the scatter dice.
